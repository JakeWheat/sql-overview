This project contains grammars for the ANSI SQL Standards (taken from
the drafts).

TODO
Cover most of the SQL Standard:

explain what the concepts are. Document the names for these in the SQL
standard, and what names products use.

Focus mostly on grammar, but also on semantics. Explain and give
examples of sql source, and cover the availability of these in sql
products, mentioning the compatibility with the standard and other
products, and the jargon used for each product.

The reader should go away with:

* an understanding of what is in the standard and what the names of
  things really mean

* an understanding of which bits of the standard are widely supported,
  which bits are widely supported but with varying syntax or
  behaviour, and which bits exist only in the minds of the sql
  standards people and don't relate to reality

* an understanding of why features exist and what purpose they are for

* an understanding of which features are supported in a range of
  common products

* a good and in depth appreciation for sql's strengths and weaknesses

Provisional product list ideas: db2, oracle, sql server, sap dbmss,
postgresql, mysql.

TODO: cross referenced grammar

What kinds of features are in the standards:

1 syntax which everyone supports
2 syntax which many dbmss support
3 features which many dbmss support with different syntax
4 features which many dbmss support, possibly with different syntax,
  with not very similar semantics
5 features which no or very few dbmss support

core conformance, postgres does 160, and no database product does all
of these
